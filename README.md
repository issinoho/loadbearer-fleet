# loadbearer-fleet

A fleet dashboard over collected [loadbearer](https://github.com/issinoho/loadbearer)
results: point it at the folder your deployment tool drops `.json` result files
into, and it indexes them and reports across the estate — executive summary,
grouping, drilldown, and the outliers and red flags worth acting on.

**Status: early.** Ingest, cohort analytics and the red-flag engine work from
the command line; the web UI and authentication are not built yet. See
[Roadmap](#roadmap).

## How it fits together

```
  PDQ / Intune / Ansible          this
  runs loadbearer on each   ->   \\share\loadbearer\*.json   ->   index   ->   dashboard
  machine, writes --output          (source of truth)          (derived)
```

Three decisions shape everything else:

**The folder is the source of truth.** The index is a derived read model and
holds nothing that isn't in the files. Delete it and it rebuilds — which is why
its schema can change freely, why there is nothing to migrate, and why it isn't
something you need to back up.

**It reads the schema, not loadbearer's code.** loadbearer's `VERSIONING.md`
makes the `schema`-tagged JSON a stability contract and says in the same breath
that its internal Rust API is not one. So this parses the document. The two
projects release independently and the contract between them is the thing
that's actually promised.

**Data quality is a first-class input, not an afterthought.** loadbearer records
when a run shouldn't be taken at face value — a thermally limited machine, a
measurement taken on battery, a `--target-dir` that turned out to be a RAM disk,
a component a security policy blocked. Ranking an estate while ignoring those
would produce confident nonsense, so they're indexed alongside the numbers and
surfaced.

## Usage

```
loadbearer-fleet scan \\fileserver\loadbearer      # index a folder (or re-index it)
loadbearer-fleet status                            # what's in the index
loadbearer-fleet report                            # summary, cohorts and red flags
loadbearer-fleet report --all                      # include informational flags
loadbearer-fleet report --json                     # the whole snapshot, as the UI will see it
```

Rescanning is cheap and idempotent: every run is keyed by the SHA-256 of the
document it came from, so an unchanged file is a no-op and a file the collector
renamed on copy doesn't become a second run.

## Identity, and why grouping is trustworthy

Runs are attributed to a machine by the best identifier the result carries:

| | survives a reimage | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `serial` | yes | what asset, warranty and lease records key on |
| `smbios_uuid` | yes | absent on some VMs |
| `machine_id` | **no** | always readable; resets on reimage |
| `hostname` | no | renameable and reissued — a last resort |

This matters in practice and not just in theory: on Windows all four are
readable by any user, but on Linux the DMI serial and UUID are root-only, so an
unprivileged sweep there keys on `machine_id`. In testing against seven real
machines, three keyed on `serial` and four on `machine_id`. The dashboard
reports which, because "four of your machines are keyed on an identifier that
resets when they're reimaged" is something an estate owner should know.

## Roadmap

- [x] Schema reader, tolerant of older files and forward-compatible with new fields
- [x] Folder scan into a SQLite index, idempotent by content, full history retained
- [x] Cohort analytics — compare a machine against its own peer group, and against
      its own history, rather than against the reference baseline
- [x] Red flags: low grades, cohort outliers, regressions, weak components, thermal
      limits, forced runs, partial runs, RAM-backed disk targets, battery wear,
      stale results, weak identity
- [ ] Web UI: executive summary, cohort explorer, machine drilldown with history
- [ ] Entra ID / OIDC SSO, roles from group claims, tag-scoped authorization
- [ ] Service packaging, config file, metrics

## Analysis

### Peers first, then history, then the baseline

The reference baseline answers "is this machine any good". It is the wrong tool
for "is this machine broken": loadbearer's own baseline header puts ±10–20%
uncertainty on the anchors, and some of them rest on three machines. A 15%
shortfall against the baseline could be the baseline.

So the primary comparison is **a machine against its peers**, and the secondary
one is **a machine against its own history** — which is stronger still, because
the hardware is held constant. A machine 15% down on forty identical machines in
the same estate, or 15% down on its own last four runs, is the machine.

A cohort is not "machines with the same CPU" but machines with the same CPU
*measured the same way*: `build_isa`, `duration_preset`, `profile` and `baseline`
each change the number without anything changing about the machine, so each is
part of the cohort key. Installed RAM deliberately is not — two machines with the
same CPU and different DIMM configurations really do differ, and surfacing the
single-channel one is the point rather than something to excuse.

Cohorts use **median and median absolute deviation**, not mean and standard
deviation, because the statistic has to survive the thing it is looking for. Six
machines at 1000 and two at 720 have a mean of 930 and a standard deviation of
118, which puts the two bad ones 1.8 sigma out — invisible to a 3.5-sigma rule,
because each one's damage is partly absorbed into the spread the other is
measured against. The median stays at 1000 and names both. On a fleet of clones
MAD collapses towards zero, so the dispersion is floored at a fraction of the
median; that floor is usually what binds, and it puts the effective trigger at
around a 15% shortfall.

### Three queues, not one wall of red

Findings are separated by what you would do about them, because mixing them
means an estate owner reads a thermal caveat as a failing asset:

| Queue | Means | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **machine** | a hardware decision — repair, replace, reassign | low grade, cohort outlier, regression, one weak component, worn battery |
| **measurement** | the number can't be trusted until collection is fixed | thermally limited, run on battery, partial run, RAM-backed disk target, unstable CPU timings |
| **coverage** | about the data we hold, not about the machine | stale result, attributed by hostname only, no peer group |

Every threshold lives in one struct with its reasoning attached, so tuning the
engine is a config change rather than a code read.
